# XVN
That stands for X-Team Visual Novel engine ;)

## Instructions
- Clone this
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` and go to the URL on the terminal.
- If you're only interested in editing the script that is being played, the file inside the `scripts` folder is all you need to change.


## FAQ

**Even after changing the script file and saving it, the browser still has an older, cached version of the script.**

Try doing a hard refresh on your browser, that should solve it. (CTRL + F5, or Cmd + Shift + F5).


## Repository TODO
* Document the XVN language
